### The webapp covers the following user stories
```
- As a user, I can view all contestants' costume images in some kind of list
- As a user, I can view all details about a single contestant
- As a user, I can upvote individual contestants 
- As a user, I can add a contestant
- As an user on a secret page, I can delete contestants
```
The secret page is..... well, a secret. *The Jack-O-Lanterns seem to be interactable though*
